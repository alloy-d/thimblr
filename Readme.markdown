Thimblr
=======

Thimblr helps you produce Tumblr themes. As mwunch puts so eloquently in the project that inspired this one, Thimble, it "protects your fingers from tedious copy-pasting."

Installation
------------

    gem install Thimblr

That's it!

Project Status
--------------
This project is by no means complete! But it works reasonably well, so I thought I'd get it out there.

Still to do:

* Get 'pages' working properly
* Get notes working, day pages and tag pages
* Make the importer that grabs post data from Tumblr
* Some other tweaks (search the repo for 'TODO:')
